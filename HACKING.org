* Overview
The prep tool is used as an aid to enrich [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DTBook][DTBook XML]] with markup
needed to render Braille. It is implemented as a plugin to the oXygen
XML editor.

** Why edit the text as opposed to the document tree
The current implementation of the plugin does the markup enrichment
directly in the text and does not parse the XML. This has some
problems in that we have to deal with gruesome regular expressions
which try to match across the XML tags (see the whole business with
the skipper and the interval tree, trying to hide the XML tags). So on
the one hand this is a drawback. On the other hand it keeps us from
having to synchronize the document tree with the text, as while we are
manipulating the document tree the user might at the same time modify
the text.


* Class Overview
** PrepToolsPluginExtension.java
Deals with initializing the (Swing) Menu bars, tool bar, etc. It also
makes sure that some menu items which are implicitly resetting the
state of a document are wrapped, so that the prep tool can be notified
of these events. These are the "Revert" and the "Save as"
menus. Similarly when switching to another prep tool while the current
one is still active we need to make sure that the user is warned and
the state of the prep tool is reset.

** OxygenEditGrouper.java
Group a bunch of edits so that they can be undone with one undo

** DocumentMetaInfo.java
Store info such as current active prep tool, state of each prep tool
or current cursor position. This is needed to reflect it in the tool
bar but also for example to check if the user changed the cursor
position behind the prep tools back.

** PrepToolsValidatorPluginExtension.java
Not needed in favor of the MenuPlugger

** AbstractPrepToolAction.java

** PrepTool.java

** PrepToolLoader.java

** TrafficLight.java

** VFormActionHelper.java

** DocumentUtils.java
Allows you to do multiple replacements inside a Document
(javax.swing.text.Document). This allows you to do a more intelligent
modification of the text.

** FileUtils.java
Implements basename

** MarkupUtil.java
Implements search in the context of skippable regions. Also contains
utility methods to handle xml start and end tags.

** Match.java
Simple data structure for region, i.e. start and end points.

** PositionMatch.java
Implements regions in a document which are immune to changes. This is
done using the functionality of a swing document which implements this.

** MetaUtils.java
Manage meta info in the XML. Namely enables to put the information
which prep tool has been run for this document into the meta data
section of the document. This is not used currently but there is a
pending feature request which is implemented using this functionality.

** ParensUtil.java
Helper methods for finding unbalanced parens

** PropsUtils.java
Utility functions to read version info from a properties file.

** RegionSkipper.java
** TextUtils.java
** VFormUtil.java

* Individual PrepTools
The following is a short description of each individual
preptool. 

** XSLT Migration
Since there is an idea to [[Future Work][implement the preptools using XSLT]] a
discussion of feasibility of such a migration is included. The idea
is to replace the preptools written in Java by one generic preptool
that knows how to treat specially marked-up DTBook files. An external
XSLT checks the xml and inserts special markes which contain both
alternatives, e.g. for the vform it could be something along the lines
of

: <select>
:   <proposed><vform>Sie</vform></proposed>
:   <original>Sie</original>
: </select>

The preptool would simply go through all the =select= elements and ask
the user whether to use the proposed change or keep the original.

*** Pros:
- XSLT operates on xml instead of raw text

*** Cons:
- the process becomes more clunky, as we have a call to the pipeline
  in the edit->preptool->check-cycle.  particularly: Parens-PrepTool


** VForms
Searches for a collection of vforms and allows user to verify
(accept/reject).  Offers two different patterns of matching vforms
(presumably for old and new spelling) selectable via a check box.

*** XSLT Migration
Migration to XSLT should be possible. Challenge: how to handle user's
choice of pattern. The XSLT would have to be parametrized.

** Parens
Finds balanced parens and wrongly oriented quotation marks. Also
handles nested parens. Other than the usual prep tool this one just
notifies the user of unbalanced parens and leaves the work up to the
user to fix.

*** XSLT Migration
Unclear if this makes sense to migrate. While balanced parens could be
inplemented the problem with nesting seems not such a great fit for XSLT.

** Ordinal
Finds potential ordinal numbers and allows user to verify
(accept/reject).

*** XSLT Migration
Migration to XSLT should be possible.

** Roman
Finds potential roman numbers and allows user to verify
(accept/reject).

*** XSLT Migration
Should be possible.

** Measure
Finds potential measure numbers and allows user to verify
(accept/reject).

*** XSLT Migration
Should be possible.

** Abbreviation
Finds potential abbreviations and allows user to verify
(accept/reject).

*** XSLT Migration
Might be a bit hairy due to the complicated regexp but should be possible.

** Url/Email
Finds potential urls/emails and allows user to verify (accept/reject).

*** XSLT Migration
Should be possible.

** Pagebreak
Finds faulty page breaks, i.e. page breaks that are the only element
between two =p=, and allows user to verify (accept/reject) or to add a
=class= attribute with value =precedingemptyline=. In other words this
prep tool allows for three choices:

1. Leave as is
2. move inside =p=
3. move inside =p= and add class =precedingemptyline=

*** XSLT Migration
Implementation in XSLT should be possible, however, it is not clear at
the moment how the choice of three options would be handled.

** Accent
Finds accents and allows user to verify (accept/reject). The
difference to other preptools: once a word has been marked with a
certain choice, the same choice is applied globally to all occurrences
of the word in the text.  This functionality would need to be
implemented in the generic preptool.

*** XSLT Migration
The point of this is that you only get asked once. For all the other
prep tools you are queried for each instance where a potential change
is found. However in the case of accents the user wants to change all
occurences of a certain word. This could probably be marked up in XSLT
but would most likely require a dedicated tool in the editor. Not just
the plain yes/no GUI.


* Future work
There is an effort underway within the [[http://www.daisy.org/pipeline2][DAISY pipeline 2 project]] to
create a set of what they call pre-processing steps which have a
similar goal: To enrich XML with additional markup to make it ready
for Braille generation. These steps will probably be based on XML
technologies, i.e. XSLT and XProc and will also interact with the
user, e.g. to confirm an enrichment. How this interaction will be and
if it could be integrated in an oXygen editor plugin remains to be
seen.
